# Advance-Student-Attendance-System
The system incorporates biometric recognition technology, such as facial recognition, to uniquely identify each student. Students' biometric data is securely stored in a centralized database, ensuring privacy and data protection. 
The system is based on  the machine learning algorithm which is  to be implemented on python language and using computer/laptop camera for the input image of the students or a normal outer camera can also be used. This device is installed in the classroom, where and student's information, such as name, roll number, class, sec, and photographs, is trained. The images are extracted using Open CV. Before the start of the corresponding class, the student can approach the machine, which will begin taking pictures and comparing them to the qualified dataset. The image is processed as follows: first, faces are identified using a Haarcascade classifier, then faces are recognized using the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) Algorithm, histogram data is checked against an established dataset, and the device automatically labels attendance. An Excel sheet is developed.
